# AMPLIFTED – Music Player UI

**AMPLIFTED** is a Gaana.com–style music player interface built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.  
It focuses on recreating a modern streaming UI: sidebar queue, trending sections, song cards, and a fixed bottom audio bar.

> ⚠️ This is a **UI clone for learning**. Cover images and song names are used only as references. The live demo currently uses placeholder audio paths.

---

## 🔍 Overview

The goal of this project is to practice:

- Building a **music streaming UI layout**
- Using **Bootstrap** for responsive grids and navbar
- Writing custom CSS for a modern, glassy, dark theme
- Hooking up a simple **audio player** with JavaScript

The page is fully front-end and can be hosted on GitHub Pages.
